# Linked_List-Application-Project
This C project implements an application using Linked Lists and Radix Sort to manage a 2-level hierarchy of Palestinian districts and towns. The application reads data from an input file, sorts the districts alphabetically and towns by population, and performs various operations based on user input.
# Features:
1. Load input file (districts.txt) containing district, town, and population data.
2. Display loaded information before sorting.
3. Sort districts alphabetically using Radix Sort.
4. Sort towns within districts based on population in ascending order.
5. Print sorted district and town information.
6. Add a new district and sort the list.
7. Add or delete towns from a district.
8. Delete a district and its towns.
9. Calculate Palestine's total population, and find max/min town populations.
10. Print districts and total population (without town details).
11. Change the population of a town.
12. Save sorted information to an output file (sorted_districts.txt).
13. Exit the program.

Note: The Radix Sort function is currently not working correctly.
